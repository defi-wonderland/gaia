/// Abstracts the underlying search index implementation (OpenSearch, Elasticsearch, etc.).
///
/// This trait defines the interface for all search index backend implementations. Implementations
/// are injected into `SearchIndexService` to enable dependency injection and easy testing with
/// mock implementations.
///
/// All methods return `Result<T, SearchIndexError>` for consistent error handling across
/// different backend implementations.
///
/// # Note on Document Creation
///
/// There is no separate `create_document` function because all grc-20 events are edits (updates).
/// The `update_document` function performs an upsert operation: it will create the document if
/// it doesn't exist, or update it if it does exist.
///
/// # Index Initialization
///
/// Implementations should call `ensure_index_exists` during application startup to ensure
/// the search index and any aliases are properly configured before performing document operations.
